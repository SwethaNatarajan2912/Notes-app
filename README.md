commands to run and description:

  ðŸ”¹node app.js list -> list the existing notes title
  ðŸ”¹node app.js read --title="nodejs" -> This is for example only. value of title should be the existing title of notes. otherwise it throw NOTE NOT FOUND
  ðŸ”¹node app.js add --title="a" --body="b" -> [Value of title is heading of the notes and value of body is content of the notes. Both title and body is required while running add command. if not, it throws missing requirements error. if we try to add the notes with existing title, it will return NOTE TITLE TAKEN command]
  ðŸ”¹node app.js remove --title="a" -> [remove the notes with that title only. if you mention non-existing title it will return NO NOTE FOUND, otherwise it will return the command as NOTE REMOVED ]

Note: if we run the command without providing the required properties for add, read or remove commands. It will show the brief information about that particular command like what are the required properties need to be add for getting the correct output
for example: node app.js add/node app.js remove/node app.js read

Exception : node app.js list command is exception from this case. Because it doesn't have any required properties to get the output. Just run the command is enough to get the actual output
